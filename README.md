# ü©∫ Kidney Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting kidney diseases, such as cysts, stones, and tumors, from CT scan images using **deep learning** models. By leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the aim is to automate the classification of kidney conditions with high accuracy. 

---

## üéØ Goal

- Develop a robust deep learning pipeline to classify kidney diseases (cysts, stones, tumors, and normal) from CT scans.
- Compare the effectiveness of **VGG16** and **MobileNetV2** architectures in this application.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - CT scan images are resized and normalized for consistency.
   - Classes include cyst, stone, tumor, and normal kidney conditions.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - **VGG16**: Known for its deep architecture and high classification accuracy.
   - **MobileNetV2**: Lightweight and efficient, designed for mobile and embedded applications.

3. **Training**:
   - Optimizer: Adam
   - Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy
   - Learning Rate: Decayed using a scheduler for optimal convergence.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy and Loss during training and validation phases.
   - Confusion Matrix for detailed performance analysis.

## üß© Features

- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances robustness by generating diverse training samples.
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluates VGG16 and MobileNetV2 in terms of accuracy, loss, and misclassification.
- **Visualization**: Uses metrics and confusion matrices for insights.

## üîç Results

| Model         | Accuracy | Validation Accuracy | Loss   |
|---------------|----------|---------------------|--------|
| **VGG16**     | 97.41%   | 96.79%              | 0.0739 |
| **MobileNetV2**| 98.04%   | 97.57%              | 0.1425 |

**Key Insights**:
- Both models perform well, with **MobileNetV2** achieving slightly higher accuracy but exhibiting a higher loss.
- **VGG16** shows better error management and stability during training.

## üñºÔ∏è Visualizations

### Accuracy and Loss Graphs
Include training vs. validation accuracy and loss graphs to visualize model performance.

```python
# Sample visualization code
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Train Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.title('Model Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Confusion Matrix
A confusion matrix provides detailed insights into model predictions.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Input**: CT scan images categorized into four classes: cyst, stone, tumor, normal.
2. **Processing**: Images are preprocessed and passed through VGG16 and MobileNetV2 architectures.
3. **Output**: The model predicts the kidney condition based on learned features.
